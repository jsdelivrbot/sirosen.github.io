Some Thoughts on April 4th
===

Permit me a moment of morbidity: April 4th is a very inauspicious day.

On April 4th, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot.
This event, 50 years ago today, is one of the great tragedies of the modern
era.

As April 4th also celebrates my birth, and I have long been overly-cognizant
of this meaningless correlation, it is a good time for self-indulgent and
grandiose reflection on ethics and justice.

Permit me one more liberty: to ask that if you read this, you engage with those
grand ideas, especially as they pertain to everyday ethics and everyday
justice.
