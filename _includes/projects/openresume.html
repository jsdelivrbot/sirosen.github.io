<p>My resume is scraped from GitHub, and included on my
<a href="/resume">resume page</a> with a JQuery <code>load</code>,
but the real magic is behind the html.</p>

<p>I want to keep a LaTeX resume so that I can supply a PDF, but also an HTML
version of it to embed on my site.
Rather than maintaining two copies of the same content in different formats, I
decided to build a system that would allow me to produce both the PDF and HTML
outputs from a single source document.
In 2015, I finally took the time to build this, using Ruby's ERB templating as
the mechanism for rendering structured resume information to these formats.</p>

<p>The resume source is a JSON document -- it's exact schema is ill-defined,
since I'm the only one using it and it changes to suit my needs.
That JSON is rendered to HTML and to LaTeX source via ruby ERB templating.
The basic flow is (1) load from JSON, (2) scrub to texify or HTML-escape things
like ampersands and underscores, and (3) run ERB.
The LaTeX is handed off to <code>pdflatex</code> to do its wizardry, and the
HTML is included here.
There is a Makefile which exists to pass arguments to the ruby script, but does
little else.</p>

<p>Please feel free to use
<a href="https://github.com/sirosen/OpenResume">the source</a>
either as a jumping-off point for your own resume templating needs, or use the
generated LaTeX source as a template for your own Resume or CV.</p>
