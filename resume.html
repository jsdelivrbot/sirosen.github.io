<h1><a name="code" class="anchor" href="#code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code</h1>

<p>This resume is scrapped from GitHub, and displayed in the form of a png.
The png is rendered with ImageMagick from a pdf as part of my compilation process.
I previously used the Google Docs embeddable viewer, but there are nasty secrets to the viewer relating to per-account bandwidth capping.</p>

<p>It is therefore kept reasonably well up to date, and will have updates applied as early as possible.
Please feel free to use <a href="https://github.com/sirosen/OpenResume">the source</a> as a template for your own LaTeX Resume or CV.</p>

<p>I have been considering transforming this resume to Markdown, in which case I will want to work out some kind of templating so that both Markdown and LaTeX can be built from the same source.
Most likely, the resume content will be stored in JSON format, and templated with Jinja or Mustache.
If I perform this work, I will attempt to add some kind of generic document on this page about how I produced the source for different resume forms.</p>

<p>I flatly refuse to ever convert this document into a .doc, .docx, .odt, or other Word-friendly format.</p>

<p>I dislike the Document Editor formats for a resume because a resume is about presentation, and Document Editors are about modifying text.
As a result, .doc editors compromise the consistency of their rendition of a document, and there is no guarantee that a document appears on the destination as it appears on my own machine.
I've very carefully crafted my resume to look exactly how I want it to, and agonized over it giving the correct visual impression to companies reading it.
There's no particular advantage to a .doc over a .pdf, but there are certainly risks and disadvantages.</p>
